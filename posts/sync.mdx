title: Sync data with Anki
lastUpdated: '2025-10-24'

Vocab Builder utilizes [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) to sync data with Anki. AnkiConnect is an Anki add-on that exposes an HTTP API, allowing other applications, scripts, or web apps to interact programmatically with Anki.

Since only the Anki Desktop app supports add-ons, you'll need a computer to perform syncing. Moreover, because AnkiConnect only works in a local environment, you'll need to install a browser extension to perform syncing.

The extension, called `Vocab Builder Sync`, can be found at the following links:

- [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vocab-builder-sync/onkpgkdgglhfdnbnpdlboaahdhgcndgd)
- [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/vocab-builder-sync/ailgmgpjdhmlcogboelaoogdmciojfgn)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vocab-builder-sync/)

<Aside>
	The extension displays syncing status through system notifications, so please ensure that your browser has notification permissions enabled.

To recap, **here are the steps to sync your Vocab Builder data with Anki**:

1. Install Anki Desktop and the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on (remember to restart Anki after installing the add-on);
2. Install `Vocab Builder Sync` in the browser;
3. Click the `Sync With Anki` button on Vocab Builder's account page.

<Aside>
	During syncing, AnkiConnect will download audio files for new notes, which may cause Anki to lag temporarily. Please be patient and wait for the
	sync to complete.

After your data is synced to Anki, you can use Anki's built-in sync service to upload your decks to AnkiMobile or other devices.

Inside Anki, each sentence generates three types of cards in a newly created deck called `Vocab Builder - <your username>`:

- Basic: sentence on the front, translation on the back;
- Reverse: translation on the front, sentence on the back;
- Type: type the entire sentence based on the translation (and optionally listen to the audio).

By default, Anki will automatically play the audio when you start studying. If you prefer otherwise, go to the deck's settings in Anki Desktop and check `Options → Don't play audio automatically` option.

Additionally, you can try the handy [SmarterTypeField](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1371444066) add-on to improve the typing experience — it enables case-insensitive matching and so on.

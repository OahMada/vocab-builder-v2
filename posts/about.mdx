Learning a new language is hard. One of the most tedious and mundane parts is building vocabulary, which can also be inefficient depending on how you approach it. Furthermore, even if you work hard and memorize a large number of words, you may still find yourself in situations where you know all the words individually but can't understand the sentence.

A couple of years ago, I read that **it's best to memorize words by learning how to use them â€” that is, by memorizing them in context**. So, what you should do is keep notes of sentences that contain a figure of speech that is new to you, figure out the meaning of each sentence, and memorize them using spaced repetition tools like Anki. Whether you are doing it while reading a novel, or practicing speech English with an AI tool.

But considering the effort required for note-taking, wouldn't it be better if there were a tool that could help you put everything you need together? That's the starting point of Vocab Builder.

Vocab Builder can help by generating translations in your native language, sentence audio, and phonetic symbols for words. You can also optionally add notes to a sentence to help you understand it. Then, it can transfer the data into Anki for effective memorization.

I designed Vocab Builder based on my own needs, and I hope people find it useful as well. If you encounter any issues while using it or have an idea for a feature, please contact me at [haozg44@gmail.com](mailto:haozg44@gmail.com), and I'll do my best to reply.
